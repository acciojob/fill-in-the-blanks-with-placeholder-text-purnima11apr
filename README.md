Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building whatever we want, let's use something called "Accio ipsum text".

Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this Accio ipsum text: 

`Accio ipsum dolor sit amet, join course, solve assignments, get placed above 5 lpa and live life king size.
`
